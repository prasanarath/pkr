    <h1>Early life<hr></h1>
    <p style="font-style: oblique; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna. Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[10] According to his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a mere three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat, display natural skill, and request his father to bowl to him.

        In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli, who'd espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma.Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket. Despite his abilities, he faced the setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the under-15 Delhi team.He received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave. In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.
        
        On 18 December 2006, Kohli experienced the loss of his father due to a cerebral attack.During his childhood, his father played a crucial role in supporting his cricket training. Kohli has credited his father as the one who drove him to practice every day. He has expressed his feelings of missing his father's presence at times. According to his mother, Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably after his father's death. He took cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to the sport. Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.</p>

            Comparisons to Sachin Tendulkar
            Kohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to the legendary Sachin Tendulkar, who he regarded as the epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar's "successor", he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the future. His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, who he idolized in his formative years and sought to emulate, is well-documented. Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar's style of batting, imitating his shots and attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[23] Kohli's aggressive and dynamic style has earned him accolades from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who has acknowledged Kohli's similarities to his own playing style. He has been lauded as the "new king of world cricket" by Dean Jones, a former Australian cricketer.While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra has noted that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots,[26] Kohli's skills with the bat have earned him accolades from former West Indies great Brian Lara, who has ranked him among the best batsmen in the world alongside Joe Root, the England captain at the time

        <h2>Playing style</h2>
        <p style="font-style: oblique; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
            Kohli is considered as an enterprising batsman, possessing technical abilities and a dynamic playing demeanour.[30][31] His customarily batting position in ODl cricket is at number three, with a slightly open-chested stance,[32] and a resolute grip on the bottom handle of his bat. He has been noted for his agile footwork, expansive range of strokes, and his propensity for adeptly orchestrating innings whilst thriving in high-pressure situations.[33][34] In his batting technique, Kohli tends to favour playing grounded shots rather than attempting big hits. He is appreciated for his ability to execute wrist shots and his consistent prowess in the mid-wicket and cover region </p>
